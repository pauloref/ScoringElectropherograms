classdef Score < handle
    %This class contains the result of scoring a WellList
    %   It is the class that will be handled by the Scoring Interface for
    %   review. It therefore needs to interface between the results of the
    %   Scoring function and the user.
    %This class needs to be a handle as it is going to be modifying itself
    %as the scoring proceeds.
    properties
        WellList %The well list
